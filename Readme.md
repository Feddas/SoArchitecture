# Setup

### Installation

These steps require Unity 2018.1.x or greater.

1. Download a release SoArchitecture0.0.x.zip from https://github.com/Feddas/SoArchitecture/releases

2. Unzip SoArchitecture0.0.x.zip into your projects Packages folder while Unity is closed. If Unity is open during the file transfer, Unity needs to be restarted to recognize the package.

```
ProjectFolder <- This should match the name of your Unity project
 + Assets folder
 + Packages folder <- Unzip into this folder
     + SoArchitecture0.0.x <- This folder should be created from unzipping
```

3. Start Unity
